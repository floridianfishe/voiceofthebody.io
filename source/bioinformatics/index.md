# Bioinformatics

This is a health data repository we are building with Simband. We don't assume that all Simband and SAMI developers will have ready access to living information. 

On these pages, you will find actual data from a variety of participants, which we encourage you to download and experiment with. Data is available both via direct download.

Also to be found here is the Researcher Console (coming soon)- a python tool you can use to extract data from SAMI and convert it to .csv and .mat format for analysis using MATLAB / R / SciPy.

We are actively adding health data to this repository. In the future, you will find studies conducted using different sensors, and additional contributions from our partners.

The information contained here is composed of real signals, but contains no personally identifiable information. All data has been collected in compliance with the IRB.
