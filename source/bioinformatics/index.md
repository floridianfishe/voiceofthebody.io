# Bioinformatics

Welcome to project "Bioinformatics".

This is a repository of vital signs data we are building with Simband . We don't assume that all Simband and SAMI developers will have ready access to living informationâ€”with that thought in mind, we created project "Bioinformatics".

On these pages, you will find actual data from a variety of participants, which we encourage you to download and experiment with. Data are available via direct download. We are excited to share the data we collected so far and we look forward to hear your feedback. We are seeking feedback on how we collected data and how we could do a better job at it. We would also like to hear how you plan to use this data and how this can be helpful in your research. We are especially excited to see innovative if not revolutionary ways to analyze the data shared here to gather more insights about the human body. Surprise us with amazing projects and help people collect better information about themselves.

We are actively adding de-indentified vital sign data to this repository. In the future, you will find studies conducted using different sensors, and additional contributions from our partners.

As we collect more data we will make it available in this repository. Every time we set ourselves to collect data we define a data collection "protocol". Protocols are available with each data collection so that you can cross reference and understand what we collected and how. When we collect data according to a give protocol we call it a "study". Each study focuses on a different physical or mental activity, and uses a particular combination of sensors. Below you can find a list of our studies so far.

##Conducted Studies

The information contained here is composed of real signals, but contains no personally identifiable information. All data has been collected in compliance with the IRB.
